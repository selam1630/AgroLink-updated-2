# Agrolink: Empowering Farmers, Eliminating Poverty
### Project Overview: Agrolink
Agriculture is the backbone of Ethiopia’s economy but millions of ethiopian farmers remain trapped in poverty due to a range of systemic challenges. Agrolink is a digital platform designed to empower Ethiopian farmers with better market access for their valuable product and provide them with valuable information to increase their productivity.

Our mission is to tackle the root causes of agricultural inefficiency and rural poverty by addressing five critical main points in the sector:
### Key Problems We Target
1. #### Lack of Access to Market Prices
   Many Ethiopian farmers are forced to sell their produce at unfairly low prices due to the lack of access to real-time market information and limited exposure to             different marketplaces.
   Agrolink aims to empower farmers by offering a digital platform where they can:
     * Access live market price data for crops across regions.
     * List and sell their products directly to buyers through our online marketplace.
     * Compare prices and demand, helping them make informed selling decisions.
   By bridging this gap, Agrolink ensures farmers receive fair value for their products and reducing exploitation by middlemen.

2. #### Crop Disease Identification
   Many farmers struggle to diagnose plant diseases early, leading to crop losses. We aim to introduce image-based disease detection using AI or community-sourced support      to help farmers respond faster and save their yields.
3. #### Weather Unpredictability
   With changing climate conditions, weather patterns are more dynamic than ever. Agrolink will integrate localized weather forecasts and alerts to help farmers plan           sowing, harvesting, and irrigation more efficiently and effectively.
4. #### Supply Chain Inefficiencies
   Farmers often face delays, lack of transport systems due to limited infrastructure, and poor connections to buyers. We will work on building a simplified digital supply     chain through the platform.
5. #### Absence of Localized Farming Advice
   Farming techniques that work in one region may not work in another. Our platform will offer location-aware, crop-specific guidance in Amharic languages, based on region,    soil type, and farming practices.


### Tech Stack Overview
- Frontend:
  React with TypeScript – for building a responsive, user-friendly, and dynamic web interface.
- Backend:
  Node.js with Express (TypeScript) – to handle server-side logic, API endpoints, and user authentication.
- Database:
  MongoDB – a flexible and scalable NoSQL database for storing user profiles, market data, crop records, and more.
- APIs & Integrations:
  Weather APIs – to provide real-time weather information tailored to farmers' locations.
  Agricultural Datasets – to offer localized farming advice and market insights.
  Machine Learning Model – integrated via API to enable crop disease detection based on image or symptom data.
- Hosting & Deployment - render

### Target Users
Agrolink is designed to serve the entire agricultural value chain, with a focus on empowerment. Our primary users include:

1. #### Ethiopian Farmers
   Smallholder and medium-scale farmers across Ethiopia who need access to fair marketplaces, accurate market prices, disease detection tools, and localized farming advice.

2. #### Public Buyers / Consumers
   Individuals or businesses who wish to purchase fresh produce directly from trusted local farmers.

3. #### Cooperatives & Farmer Unions
   Organizations that manage or support groups of farmers and are looking for efficient ways to market bulk produce, get advice, or access logistics.

4. #### Suppliers & Agro-dealers
   Vendors that supply seeds, fertilizers, pesticides, and farming equipment.
  

### Vision
We envision a future where every Ethiopian farmer has access to vital agricultural knowledge and real-time market connections to break the cycle of poverty. By combining technology with community, Agrolink aims to be a catalyst for inclusive and sustainable agricultural development.

### Business Features

**Note**: This is a planned project currently in the design and planning phase.

#### Feature 1: Digital Brokerage Marketplace

Agrolink acts as a trusted intermediary between farmers and buyers to ensure transparency, fair pricing, and secure payment.

Functionality:

Farmer submits product to Agrolink physically or via verified local agents.
Agrolink posts the product with:

  - Crop details (name, quantity, price)
  - Photo of the product
  - Farmer’s phone number, location, and identity
* Buyers browse the listed products, select what they want, and initiate purchase.

Transaction Process:

1. Buyer creates an account and places an order.
2. Buyer sends payment to Agrolink.
3. Agrolink deducts a small commission(platform fee).
4. The remaining amount is securely transferred to the farmer’s account.
5. Both parties are notified, and the product is shipped or picked up.

#### Feature 2: Authentication and Role Management

Functionality:

* Both farmers and buyers are required to register with their name, phone number, and role. Providing an email address is optional
* Secure login and profile management.
* Role-based access:

  * Farmers can manage product listings and view payments.
  * Buyers can browse products and make purchases.

#### Feature 3: Crop Disease Diagnosis Tool

Functionality:

* Farmers upload images of infected crops.
* AI or expert review provides:

  * Disease identification
  * Recommended treatments or next steps

#### Feature 4: Localized Weather Forecasting

Functionality:

* Region-specific weather updates using GPS data.
* Timely alerts about rain, drought, and temperature trends.
* Helps farmers plan planting, harvesting, and irrigation.

#### Feature 5: Location-Based Farming Advice

Functionality:

* Personalized guidance based on:

  * Crop type
  * Soil condition
  * Geographic location.


#### Feature 6: Transparent Transaction History

Functionality:

* Farmers and buyers can view:

  * Past orders
  * Payment status
  * Commission breakdowns
* Enhances trust and accountability.
#### Feature 7: Commission Management System

Functionality:

* Automatically deducts a small percentage from each transaction.
* Tracks platform earnings for sustainability.
* Transparent for all users to see what was charged and paid.
   
### Future Roadmap

 #### Short-Term (Next 3 Months):
 * Finalize UI/UX design mockups
 * Build MVP with core marketplace features
 * Integrate payment system 
 * Start pilot onboarding with select Ethiopian farmers
 
 #### Long-Term 
 * AI disease diagnosis expansion
 * Partnerships with cooperatives
 * Integration with Telebirr
